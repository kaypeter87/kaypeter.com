Hello friends and strangers,

I have lasted way too long without a tech blog, so I finally bit the bullet and
started one. Most of these posts will involve work stuff at [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and other projects that I'm working on. I'm
trying to follow the approach of "document as you go" and force myself to write
things as I work on projects. Who knows? Maybe I'll learn a thing or two
:smirk:.
