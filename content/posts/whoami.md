My name is Peter Kay. I write software that makes software reliable. My days consist of being a husband, 
dog dad, writing code, doing sysadmin stuff, and experimenting with stuff in electronics and code.
I am an avid open source afficiando and support the OSS community. I also love music and dabble in
music production on the side.

I believe strongly in sharing the what, where, why, and how. Sharing the choice and mistakes me made now
will hopefully save the problems we encounter tomorrow.
