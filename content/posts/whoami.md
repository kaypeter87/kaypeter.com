My name is Peter Kay. I write software that makes software reliable. I use to work at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).
My days consist of being a husband, dog dad, writing code, doing sysadmin stuff, and experimenting with stuff in
electronics and code. I am an avid open source afficiando and support the OSS community.

I believe strongly in sharing the what, where, why, and how. Sharing the choice and mistakes me made now
will hopefully save the problems we encounter tomorrow.
