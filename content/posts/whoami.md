My name is Peter Kay, I'm a Staff Site Reliability Engineer at [Flatiron
Health](https://flatiron.com). Before that, I was an SRE at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). My days consist of
writing code, being a husband, a sysadmin, failing horribly in networking, and
experimenting with my home lab. I am a firm believer in open source and its
principles.

I love my job and the people that I work with. They are some of the smartest people
that I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. At Flatiron, we're all working
towards the same mission, and that is to help out in cancer research. For a
company in the healthcare industry, we use and develop a lot of awesome tech!
This blog's purpose is to document the work that I do and the tech that I
experiment with.

I believe strongly in sharing the what, where, why, and how. Sharing the
choices and mistakes we made will hopefully save a bit of headache for some
people.
