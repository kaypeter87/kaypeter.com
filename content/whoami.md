My name is Peter Kay, I'm an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) at [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) (SO). My job is to make sure SO, the
rest of the [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com) sites, and our
network/infrastructure are running. I am focused on the application side of things
which includes [Stack Overflow
Talent](https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/talent), [Stack Overflow
Jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs), Public Q&A, Profiles, Etc...

I love my job and the people I work with. They are some of the smartest people
in the industry! But no matter how smart you are, we all make mistakes and this blog is to share all of the
ones that I've made. Learning from our mistakes is one of the key ways to
improve as an engineer and as a person.

Thanks for stopping by and reading about me. I hope my blog helps you in some meaningful way.
